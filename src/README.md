# ![Sunnee - Brand](https://via.placeholder.com/468x60/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=Sunnee+Brand)

### This project is part of the Typescript course offered by Start2Impact University and aims to develop a system in TypeScript that models the operational structure of a recycled plastic beachwear brand, focusing on customer interactions, beachwear products and sustainable production processes.

The project only requires writing code in TypeScript.

---

## Main Features

- Define an IProduct interface to represent the different items of beachwear (swimwear, parei, hats) produced with recycled plastic.

- Define an IClient interface to represent the brand’s customers.

- Define an IProcessProduction interface to represent the sustainable manufacturing processes used by Sunnee.

- Implements the Product, Customer, and ProcessProduction classes that implement the IProduct, IClient, and IProcessProduction interfaces respectively.

### Follow these instructions:

- #### Product Class: manages the information of each beachwear article and the allocation to customers.

- #### Customer Class: manages the information of customers and their ability to order products.

- #### Production class: represents a specific production process used by the brand, manages products in production and the addition of new items.

---

## Instantiate & Test

- Instantiates some objects Product to represent the different items of beachwear produced with recycled plastic.

- Instance Customer objects to represent the brand’s customers.

- Create an instance of the ProcessProduction class for one or more sustainable manufacturing processes used by the brand, adding the instantiated products to the process.

- Testing the logic of customer ordering and adding new items to production processes.

---

## Result

#### This project completes the implementation of a product, customer and production process management system for the Sunnee brand.

#### The code demonstrates how objects interact with each other, reflecting the brand’s sustainable mission.
